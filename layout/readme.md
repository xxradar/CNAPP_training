## **2. Key Components & Functional Requirements**

### **Core Components**

1. **Security Posture Management**
   - **Continuous Discovery and Mapping**: Automatically identifies and catalogs all cloud resources and configurations.
   - **Configuration Evaluation**: Assesses resource configurations against compliance policies and best practices to detect misconfigurations.

2. **Vulnerability Management**
   - **Dynamic Scanning**: Continuously scans container images, registries, and services for known vulnerabilities.
   - **Risk Assessment Prioritization**: Prioritizes vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and impact on the organization.

3. **Runtime Protection**
   - **Application Behavior Monitoring**: Establishes baselines for normal behavior to detect anomalies.
   - **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**: Identifies and responds to suspicious activities during application runtime.

4. **Compliance and Governance**
   - **Standards Adherence**: Ensures compliance with industry regulations like **SOC 2**, **ISO 27001**, and **GDPR**.
   - **Audit Trails and Reporting**: Maintains detailed logs and generates compliance reports for audits.

5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Security**
   - **Enforces Least Privilege Principle**: Ensures users have only the permissions necessary to perform their roles.
   - **Roles and Permissions Management**: Streamlines the assignment and auditing of access controls.

6. **Network Segmentation**
   - **Micro-Segmentation**: Divides the network into secure segments to prevent lateral movement of threats.
   - **Integrated Firewall and Security Policies**: Applies consistent security policies across all network segments.

### **Non-functional Requirements**

- **Performance**: The platform must introduce minimal latency to avoid impacting application performance.
- **Usability**: Features intuitive dashboards and analytics for ease of use by various stakeholders.
- **Security**: Employs robust encryption methods and strict access controls to protect sensitive data.
- **Scalability**: Supports auto-scaling to accommodate fluctuating workloads in dynamic cloud environments.

### **Constraints**

- **Budgetary Constraints**: Solutions must provide maximum value within the allocated budget.
- **Compatibility**: Must seamlessly integrate with existing cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and development tools.
