# Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs)

CNAPPs are essential for securing cloud-native applications and infrastructure. They originate from different technological backgrounds, primarily cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Kubernetes, which influences their capabilities and focus areas. Here's an overview to help your management understand these origins and the considerations when choosing a CNAPP vendor:

## Origins of CNAPP Vendors

### Cloud IaaS Background:
- **Focus:** Vendors with a cloud IaaS background focus on providing comprehensive security for cloud infrastructure, including virtual machines (VMs) and cloud services.
- **Capabilities:** These platforms often integrate cloud security posture management (CSPM), cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) capabilities. They are adept at managing security across multiple cloud environments, including hybrid and multi-cloud setups, and often support various cloud service providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

### Kubernetes Background:
- **Focus:** Vendors originating from a Kubernetes background emphasize container security and Kubernetes security posture management (KSPM).
- **Capabilities:** They offer capabilities such as runtime visibility into container workloads, infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning, and network connectivity mapping specific to Kubernetes environments. These platforms are designed to handle the unique challenges of microservices and containerized applications, providing security solutions tailored to these environments.

## Considerations When Choosing a CNAPP Vendor

### Integration and Compatibility:
- **Ensure Compatibility:** Ensure the CNAPP integrates seamlessly with your existing cloud infrastructure and development workflows. Look for support for both agent-based and agentless approaches, as well as compatibility with your cloud service providers and Kubernetes environments.

### Comprehensive Security Features:
- **Evaluate Features:** Evaluate the range of security features offered, such as threat detection, vulnerability management, and compliance monitoring. Consider whether the platform provides a unified security dashboard for managing risks across different environments.

### Vendor Support and Reputation:
- **Assess Support:** Consider the vendor's reputation, customer support, and the level of ongoing assistance they provide. It's beneficial to request demos or trials to assess the platform's usability and effectiveness in your specific context.

### Scalability and Future-Proofing:
- **Plan for Growth:** Choose a CNAPP that can scale with your organization's growth and adapt to emerging security trends. Look for platforms that offer continuous updates and improvements to address new security challenges.

### Cost and Value:
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Assess the cost-effectiveness of the CNAPP by considering the potential for consolidating multiple security tools into a single platform. This can lead to cost savings and simplified security management.

By understanding the origins and capabilities of CNAPP vendors, your organization can make informed decisions that align with its security needs and technological infrastructure.


Here's a table listing some CNAPP vendors and their respective backgrounds, based on the information available:

| **Vendor**               | **Background**                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Aqua Security**        | Kubernetes and container security               |
| **Wiz**                  | Cloud IaaS and asset management                 |
| **CrowdStrike Falcon**   | Cloud security with a focus on adversary detection |
| **Check Point CloudGuard** | Cloud IaaS security                           |
| **Prisma Cloud**         | Cloud IaaS security                             |
| **Sysdig**               | Kubernetes and container security               |

These vendors have different origins, which influence their focus and capabilities. When choosing a CNAPP vendor, it is crucial to consider your organization's specific needs and the vendor's strengths in either cloud infrastructure or Kubernetes environments.
